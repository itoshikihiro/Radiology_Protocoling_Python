Clinical Indication: CERVICAL RADICULOPATHY. 

Structured report code: 17.MSK1

Procedure:  XR Spine Cervical 4-5 Views. 

Comparison: None.

VIEWS: 5

Findings: AP, lateral, oblique and odontoid radiographs of the cervical spine
were obtained. On the lateral view, the spine is seen from the skull base
through the cervicothoracic junction. Lower cervical disc space narrowing is
noted, most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Right greater than left facet
overgrowth is seen at C3-4 and C4-C5. Right greater than left uncovertebral
hypertrophy is present at C5-C6 and C6-C7. The C1-C2 articulation is within
normal limits. Vascular clips are seen within the thyroid bed on the left.
Trachea is within the midline. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.

Impression: Mild multilevel cervical spondylosis (right greater than left).
